    <p>The C++ standard library supports a number of methods to change the value of a 
    container element. The most general method is to write a new value to an element 
    through an iterator: <code>*iter = val_new</code>. The sequence containers 
    <code>vector</code> and <code>deque</code> provide the subscript 
    <code>operator[ ]</code> and the member function <code>at()</code>. There are also 
    other ways for an algorithm to obtain a pointer or a reference to a container 
    element and use it for a write operation.     
    </p>
    <p>The problem with these methods is that they are generally not safe. This is why 
    there are a number of rules on how to use these methods in algorithms. First of all, 
    there is a fundamental restriction, which is applied to both STL and new containers. 
    All of these write methods are not safe for ordered containers, including ordered 
    sequences, such as <code>vector</code> and <code>list</code>. Other implementation 
    details of write methods, which are discussed below, are specific to the data 
    structures supporting STL variants of new containers.     
    </p>
    <p>The B+ trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> implement an optimized 
    approach to the write methods, since these data structures store container elements 
    only in the external nodes of a doubly linked list. The operation, which writes a 
    new value to an element in an external node through an iterator, is identical to 
    such an operation in any linked list and has constant computational cost. After the 
    element has been modified, all connected internal nodes operate with the new value, 
    since they access the modified element through pointers to the external node. If the 
    order of elements in a container is not modified, this approach correctly supports 
    write operations for two types of trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>: 
    the class <code>bp_tree</code> and the class <code>bp_tree_idx</code>.    
    </p>
    <p>For STL variants of containers based on the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> 
    the support for correct write operations is more complex. Although this variant of 
    a B+ tree has the same structure as the two other trees, its internal nodes store 
    additional sum data for the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. 
    A write operation, which changes a value of an element in an external node only, 
    makes additional sum data invalid in a number of internal  nodes. This simple 
    implementation makes write operations for all types of containers based on the 
    class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code>, including sequences, unsafe. 
    In order to maintain tree data valid, the change in the element value must be properly 
    reflected in the sum data in a chain of parent nodes at every level of a tree from 
    an external node to the root. For this reason in the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> 
    the safe write operation has cost <i>O(log N)</i> and is less efficient than the read 
    operation, which has constant cost.    
    </p>
    <p>One of the options to avoid these invalidation problems is to implement safe 
    write methods in user algorithms. This is a reasonable approach; however, it has 
    a complication that the safe implementation of write methods is container type 
    dependent.
    </p>
    <p>The member function</p>
    <pre>    
    std::pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt;
    write ( iterator  pos , const value_type &  val_new ) ;
</pre>    
    <p>has been added to address all types of the data invalidation problems, which can 
    be caused by the write methods. This function guarantees that a container, to which 
    an iterator points, remains in a valid state after a write operation. Thus, it can be 
    used in code instead of write operations like <code>*iter=value_new</code> discussed 
    above. Algorithms, which use this function, gain the additional advantage of being 
    able to implement more generic solutions.
    </p>
    <p>This member function is supported by every STL variant of a container of the 
    namespace <code>container_bptree</code> with computational complexity varying from 
    <i>O(1)</i> to <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case. The implementation of this function 
    for each container type is equivalent to two operations, which erase an old element 
    pointed to by an input iterator and insert a new element. This is one of the most 
    general approaches to write methods for all types of submitted containers. The 
    implementation of this function is specific to a container type, but none of them 
    changes the number of elements in a container.
