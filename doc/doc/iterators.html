    <p>Random access iterators are essential types of new containers. This section 
    covers some implementation aspects and potential problems, which may arise in 
    user algorithms.  
    </p>
    <p>Iterators of STL containers, by design, are generalizations of pointers. 
    This is why implementations of iterator classes for STL containers are often 
    based on pointers. In the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> this approach has 
    been used to implement bidirectional iterators of the class <code>bp_tree</code>. 
    Random access iterators of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>, which 
    are the focus of this section, support the semantics of both a pointer and an index 
    to a container element using the following approach. 
    </p>
    <p>The current position of an iterator is defined by two data members: a pointer 
    to an external node of the deepest doubly linked list of a B+ tree and a 
    corresponding index, which measures the distance in linear order from the first 
    node of this list to the node pointed to by the iterator pointer. For all valid 
    iterator positions the values of the iterator index and the values of the iterator pointer 
    represent two mathematical sets, since for each of these two types all possible 
    values are unique. The values of the index represent the set of non-negative 
    integers. The values of the pointer represent points in the address space, which are 
    not regular in the general case. The uniqueness of these values is supported by 
    algorithms of the memory management implemented by a system. These properties of 
    iterator data provide the basis for the implementation of one-to-one mapping between 
    the sets of index and pointer values for all valid positions of an iterator object. 
    Each operator and each member function modifier implemented in iterator classes keep 
    this mapping valid, provided that the initial data members and mapping are valid.    
    </p>
    <p>Classes of random access iterators do not place any limit on the index value. For 
    any iterator position outside the valid range of a container <code>[0, size)</code>, 
    the iterator pointer has one value, which is the address of an external end or head 
    node of a doubly linked list. This approach has the advantage that an iterator can be 
    safely returned to the last valid position even if its current position is invalid. 
    An example of such use case is shown in this demo code:    
    </p>
    <pre>
    iter  = contr.begin() ; 
    sz    = contr.size()  ; 
    iter += sz/2 ; // valid position 
    iter += sz ;   // invalid position 
    iter -= sz ;   // valid position, the same as two lines above 
</pre>
    <p>The implementation of iterator classes takes full advantage of the index data member, which 
    provides efficient support for many operators <code>{ ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, - }</code>. 
    The cost of these operators is <i>O(1)</i>, which in theory is the same as that for pointer 
    based iterators of <code>std::vector</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The implementation of increment and decrement operators of bidirectional and 
    random access iterators of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> uses the 
    connectivity of external nodes of the doubly linked list. The cost of obtaining a next 
    or a previous element of a container element using a node link is <i>O(1)</i>. 
    Thus, the cost of sequential access to each container element through an iterator 
    is <i>O(N)</i>.    
    </p>
    <p>The operators <code>{+=, -=, +, -}</code>, which move an iterator to an arbitrary 
    position within a container, in the worst case have cost <i>O(log N)</i>. Thus, 
    compared to random access iterators of <i>std::vector</i>, some loss of performance 
    with the new iterators is possible when an algorithm frequently visits distant elements 
    of a container. However, the performance of the algorithm will be much better than with 
    bidirectional iterators, which provide only linear time for the same operations. 
    For these reasons iterators of containers with efficient indexing of elements 
    (classes <code>bp_tree_idx</code> and <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code>) have been assigned 
    to the category of the random access iterator.    
    </p>
    <p>One of the major problems for algorithms using random access iterators is the 
    invalidation of an iterator, when a container pointed to by the iterator is modified 
    by operations, which add or remove elements. This is a fundamental problem in the 
    mapping of non-negative integers into container elements. It is independent of 
    a specific implementation of an iterator and arises even when an algorithm does not 
    modify an iterator directly. If the number of elements in the container is changed 
    before the iterator position, the iterator index will point to a different node and 
    hence to a different element. In this case mapping between index and pointer values 
    becomes invalid regardless of whether an index value is in a valid range or not, 
    and whether an element at the indexed position is equivalent to the old one or not.    
    </p>
    <p>In order to address potential problems of user algorithms, iterator classes 
    include a number of functions, which can be used to detect the most typical problems 
    and implement solutions specific to these algorithms.    
    </p>
    <p>The member function</p>
    <pre>
    bool valid_data ( ) const ;
</pre>    
    <p>shows whether data members of an iterator are correctly initialized. If this 
    function returns <code>false</code>, no valid mapping can be reset. This function 
    has constant cost. 
    </p>
    <p>The state of mapping of the iterator data can be checked using the member function
    </p>      
    <pre>
    bool valid_mapping ( ) const ;  
</pre> 
    <p>If mapping is invalid, the iterator must not be used in algorithms. The behaviour 
    of such iterator object, as well as container functions, which use this iterator, 
    are undefined. This function has logarithmic cost and notifies the user of the problem 
    regardless of whether an indexed position is in a valid range or not. When the function 
    returns <code>false</code>, valid mapping can be restored for logarithmic time using 
    one of the two following options.
    </p>    
    <p>The member function
    </p>
    <pre>
    void update_index ( ) ;    
</pre>         
    <p>restores valid mapping by recalculating the iterator index for the current value 
    of the iterator pointer. The function does not change the element, to which the 
    updated iterator points, before its container has been modified and after mapping has been 
    restored. This feature allows algorithms to use a random access iterator of the 
    namespace <code>container_bptree</code> as a pointer to an element, which can be 
    particularly helpful in the following applications. An algorithm requires efficient 
    random access iterators, but container update or resize operations invalidate these 
    iterators. An algorithm takes advantage of bidirectional iterators to avoid the 
    invalidation problem, but its efficiency is too low due to linear running time of 
    operations using these iterators.
    </p>    
    <p>The member function</p>
    <pre>
    void update_pointer ( ) ;
</pre> 
    <p>uses the current index value in order to find the corresponding pointer to the 
    external node. If the iterator index is not in the valid range, the iterator pointer 
    points to the head node of the deepest list. This function retains the distance 
    between the updated iterator and the iterator pointing to the first element in the 
    container. Thus, it changes the element, to which the updated iterator points.    
    </p>
    <p>Any iterator requires that a container it points to exists in main memory and is 
    in a valid state. The member function <code>update_index()</code> cannot be used if 
    an iterator points to a node, which has been already deleted. This restriction does 
    not apply to the member function <code>update_pointer()</code>, which is safe to use 
    even in this case. If an iterator was in a valid state and a container the iterator 
    points to has been modified by operations, which only insert elements, then the valid 
    state of this iterator can be restored by any of these two update functions. 
    If, however, at least one element has been erased, then only the function 
    <code>update_pointer()</code> is safe in the general case. The function 
    <code>update_index()</code> can still be used in many practical applications, but 
    the correctness of these calls is a responsibility of a user algorithm.    
    </p>
    <p>The additional non-standard functions make random access iterators of the 
    namespace <code>container_bptree</code> more versatile than STL iterators. These new 
    iterators can replace both random access and bidirectional iterators of the 
    containers of the C++ standard library in algorithms. The new member functions also 
    increase the safety of algorithms, which can use new functions to avoid problems 
    associated with invalidated iterators. These improvements have a high practical 
    importance and relatively low logarithmic cost. Note also, that basic linear data 
    structures, such as a linked list or an array, can provide only limited support for 
    the new functionality offered by the random access iterators of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The most reasonable alternative to these new iterator member functions is a search 
    for a required element using a copy object. This method can have a high computational 
    cost, such as linear search in a sequence, that is unacceptable in practical applications. 
    However, even this alternative is not always possible. In a container with multiple 
    equivalent elements the search method finds one of many equivalent elements. 
    The element is not necessary identical to an element, which has been lost 
    by an algorithm due to the invalidation of an iterator.
    </p>
    <p>For an algorithm working with a sequence container through an iterator it may be 
    required to obtain an index of an element, to which the iterator points. The current 
    version of iterator classes of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> does not 
    provide an interface function, which returns an index value of a container element, 
    for example:    
    </p>
    <pre>
    index = iter . index ( ) ;
</pre> 
    <p>This index value can be easily retrieved using one of the already available 
    STL methods:    
    </p>  
    <pre>
    index = std::distance ( contr.begin() , iter ) ; // or
    index = iter - contr.begin() ;
</pre> 
    <p>Each of these two options has constant cost.
    </p>
    <h3>
    Iterators and accumulators
    </h3>
    <p> 
    In theory, random access iterators of the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> can efficiently 
    support extended functionality. In particular, they can represent in user algorithms objects 
    of accumulators. These iterators could implement the member function 
    <code>accumulated_value()</code>, which would return a stored accumulated value of 
    the container elements in the range <code>[0, </code><i>I</i><code>)</code>, where 
    <i>I</i> is the number of container elements before the iterator position. With this member 
    function the sum of consecutive elements specified by two iterators can be calculated 
    as the difference of two accumulated values:
    </p>
    <pre> 
    sum = iter_b.accumulated_value() - iter_a.accumulated_value() ;
    </pre>
    <p>    
    The main advantage of the member function <code>accumulated_value()</code> is that the sum 
    value is calculated in constant time only. This fact suggests that the computational 
    complexity of algorithms based on the function <code>accumulate()</code> can be reduced 
    down to the absolute theoretical minimum. In particular, the mean value and standard deviation 
    of any number of consecutive elements can be calculated in constant time. 
    </p>
    <p>    
    The support of the accumulator functionality looks very attractive, however, it has a number of 
    limitations. First of all, there is a cost associated with moving an iterator to a specified position 
    and simultaneous updating its accumulated value. In the worst case this cost is <i>O(log N)</i>, 
    where <i>N</i> is the total number of elements in a container. The fast member function 
    <code>accumulate()</code> is more efficient in this case, since its cost is <i>O(log D)</i>, 
    where <i>D</i> is the number of consecutive container elements to sum up. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The second practically important problem of the extended iterators with the member function 
    <code>accumulated_value()</code> is the loss of accuracy of algorithms based on floating data types. 
    For <i>D</i> consecutive container elements in the range <code>[</code><i>F</i><code>, 
    </code><i>F</i><code>+</code><i>D</i><code>)</code>, where <i>F</i> is the index of the first 
    element, the sum of values is calculated as the difference of two accumulated values in 
    the ranges <code>[0, </code><i>F</i><code>+</code><i>D</i><code>)</code> and 
    <code>[0, </code><i>F</i><code>)</code>. 
    The numerical error of this method depends not only on the values of <i>D</i> consecutive 
    elements, but also on the values of first <i>F</i> elements of the container. 
    In the general case the error becomes significant when <i>F</i><code>>></code><i>D</i> and/or 
    the accumulated value of first <i>F</i> elements is huge compared to the result sum value. 
    The member function <code>accumulate()</code> processes only the required <i>D</i> 
    consecutive elements and, thus, avoids this problem, see also the discussion of basic 
    algorithms in the section <a href="bp_trees.html">Design and implementation of B+ trees</a>.
