    <h3>Introduction
    </h3>  
  
    <p>All variants of B+ trees discussed in previous sections are dynamically allocated. 
    The implementation of these trees requires no pointer arithmetic. To some extent this is 
    an advantage, since these trees do not place a strict restriction on a model of a computational 
    machine. These variants of augmented B+ trees can be implemented not only in C++, but also 
    in any other programming language that supports pointers. 
    </p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, it is well known that containers using the pointer arithmetic 
    can provide significantly better performance of some operations compared to containers 
    based on dynamically allocated linked data structures. In particular, for this reason 
    the default STL sequence container is array based <code>std::vector</code>, but not 
    dynamically allocated <code>std::list</code>. The section 
    <a href="performance.html">Performance of basic algorithms</a> includes values of running 
    times of several basic member functions of these STL containers.
    </p>
    
    <p>The superiority of array based containers raises the interesting question if it is possible 
    to develop variants of augmented B+ trees, which take advantage of the high efficiency of 
    the pointer arithmetic. The performance of new B+ trees can be compared with that of previously 
    developed variants of dynamically allocated B+ trees. It is also necessary to ensure 
    that the benefits of new STL variants of containers and iterators do not come at the expense of 
    generality and portability.
    </p>

    <h3>Transformation of dynamically allocated into array based B+ trees
    </h3>  
    
    <p>The array based variants of augmented B+ trees can be developed from scratch using 
    the similarity with external search trees. In order to reduce the development time, 
    this project applies a different approach. The new variants of array based B+ trees are 
    obtained by a relatively simple adaption of already developed dynamically allocated B+ trees. 
    In particular, an array based B+ tree of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> represents 
    an equivalent of a dynamically allocated B+ tree of the class <code>bp_tree_idx</code>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The transformation of dynamically allocated into array based B+ trees has been mainly 
    achieved through a modification of the structure of external nodes of the deepest level. 
    Every group of external child nodes is replaced by an array storing the same container elements. 
    This is why in a new B+ tree a linked list of nodes of the deepest level is represented by 
    a list of arrays. The structure of all levels of internal nodes remains unchanged. 
    The following figure shows the structure of indices of an array based B+ tree.
    </p>
    
    </p>
    <p>
    <img alt="" src="images/figure_2.png" style="height: 500px; width: 870px" />    
    </p>
    <table class="style1">
        <tr>
            <td class="style2">
            </td>
            <td>
                <b>Figure 2.</b> An array based B+ tree with the minimum degree <i>t</i>=2 and 
                an array storing the same elements.                 
                <br />
                The deepest level of the B+ tree implements a partition of the array into 
                a list of sub-arrays. Values in internal nodes of the B+ tree represent counters of 
                elements. Empty cells in sub-arrays of external nodes do not store container elements. 
                They are reserved for new elements to be inserted into the tree. The dashed lines 
                connect first elements in sub-arrays of external nodes of the tree with corresponding 
                elements in the array. 
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>The modification of the deepest level is based on the following facts. One group of 
    external child nodes of a dynamically allocated B+ tree represents a doubly linked list. 
    The links to previous and next nodes support constant time access to nearest elements only. 
    The pointer arithmetic provides the advantage of constant time access to any element inside an array. 
    In this regard, an array of nodes with container elements supersedes the doubly linked list of nodes. 
    This fact has been used in this project in order to replace every group of external child nodes with 
    an array of light nodes. The pointer arithmetic, however, cannot be used when an algorithm requires 
    access to a distant container element from another array. If this is the case, the required element 
    is delivered by an efficient search algorithm using the structure of internal nodes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>To some extent, this transformation into an array based B+ tree is incomplete, since 
    the obtained data structure is a combination of a list of arrays of external nodes and 
    a dynamically allocated B-tree of internal nodes. Nevertheless, as it will be seen later, 
    even this partial transformation of the augmented B+ trees is sufficient to significantly 
    improve performance of many container operations. 
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of pointer arithmetic
    </h3>  
    
    <p>The use of the pointer arithmetic provides a number of major benefits for the performance 
    of the new variants of augmented B+ trees against previously developed dynamically allocated trees. 
    The pointer arithmetic provides the most efficient constant time access to any element inside 
    an array and the possibility to maximize spatial locality of reference. 
    </p>

    <p>The fact that an array of nodes can replace a linked list of nodes makes links to previous 
    and next nodes redundant and, thus, allows for saving space required for array based B+ trees. 
    The reduced space requirement can give a noticeable performance gain for algorithms processing 
    small size objects. 
    </p>

    <p>In addition to this, the pointer arithmetic can be used to store consecutive elements of 
    a container in a contiguous region of memory. This method minimizes the number of cache misses 
    and maximizes performance of algorithms using sequential processing. 
    </p>

    <p>For these reasons, the array based B+ trees provide much better spatial localities of reference 
    not achievable in dynamically allocated variants of B+ trees, including those using custom allocators. 
    </p>

    <h3>Processing by sub-arrays
    </h3>  

    <p>Copy semantics algorithms of dynamically allocated B+ trees normally process <i>N</i> elements 
    applying an operation <i>N</i> times. For example, in order to add <i>N</i> elements to the tail of 
    a sequence, the member function <code>push_back()</code> is called <i>N</i> times.
    </p>
    
    <p>The efficiency and generality of the pointer arithmetic enables the development of new methods 
    with improved performance for large numbers of elements not possible with dynamically allocated 
    data structures. The idea of this optimization is to replace multiple processing of single elements 
    by single processing of an array with the same elements. In particular, for the example mentioned above, 
    instead of multiple calls of the <code>push_back()</code> function for every single element, 
    it is more efficient to create and fill an array of elements, then create its parent node and 
    push back the node to the deepest internal level of a B+ tree.
    </p>

    <p>The first four rows of the next table show values of running times in milliseconds of the 
    <code>push_back()</code> function for two standard containers and for two sequences based on B+ trees, 
    the test function <code>PerformanceTest::test_push_back_fill()</code>, the file &quot;perform_tests.hpp&quot;. 
    The last row shows data for the new method that inserts sub-arrays into a B+ tree of the class 
    <code>bp_tree_array</code>, the test function <code>PerformanceTest::test_insert_fill()</code>. 
    </p>

    </tr>
    </table>
  <br />  

    <p>These data demonstrate the effect of methods that improve performance of new data structures. 
    The improved locality of reference increases the efficiency of array based B+ trees approximately 
    by 4 times compared to dynamically allocated trees. The method of insertion of container elements 
    using sub-arrays provides an additional improvement factor of about 2.5. This method is almost as 
    efficient as the <code>push_back()</code> function of <code>std::vector</code>.
    </p>

    <p>These measurements also show that the member function <code>push_back()</code> of a sequence 
    based on an array based B+ tree has better performance than that of <code>std::list</code>. 
    In theory, the result is unexpected, since the computational cost of this function is constant for 
    <code>std::list</code> and is logarithmic for an array based B+ tree. 
    </p>

    <p>This interesting fact is a demonstration of the inaccuracy of asymptotical estimates for complex 
    computer systems using virtual memory management. It also suggests that a well-designed library 
    should provide a variety of data structures supporting one interface, such as STL, to give users 
    the choice of the most efficient basic data structure for a specific solution. 
    </p>

    <p>The following test compares the efficiency of the <code>sequence</code> member function 
    <code>unique()</code> of two containers using an array based B+ tree of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    and a dynamically allocated B+ tree of the class <code>bp_tree_idx</code>. The improvement factor 
    for this test varies between 5 and 30. The table shows values of running times in milliseconds 
    against the number of elements processed by the member function <code>unique()</code>, the test 
    function <code>PerformanceTest::test_unique()</code>, the file &quot;perform_tests.hpp&quot;. 
    </p>

    </table>
  <br />  

    <p>In order to achieve the best performance of user algorithms, the new B+ trees support two 
    minimum degree parameters: one for internal dynamically allocated nodes <code>_min_degree_int()</code> 
    and one for external nodes <code>_min_degree_ext()</code> stored in arrays of the deepest level of a tree. 
    The higher efficiency of the pointer arithmetic, the greater the value of the minimum degree can be set 
    for an external level. This parameter increases the capacity of every array, reduces the total 
    number of internal nodes, saves space and increases locality of reference. This variation can 
    improve performance of search methods and sequential processing. However, since a single update 
    operation for a sub-array has linear running time, the increase can be costly for the overall 
    performance of complex algorithms. These facts mean that values of the minimum degree parameters 
    that deliver the best efficiency may vary from algorithm to algorithm. It is also possible that 
    the optimal values of these parameters are system specific. If required, these properties of 
    the array based B+ trees can be used to develop the most efficient specialized solutions. 
    </p>


    <h3>Fast conversion to <code>std::vector</code> 
    </h3>  

    <p>The high performance methods of the pointer arithmetic have been used in many member functions of 
    the array based B+ trees, including such important special functions as constructors and destructors. 
    The reduced cost of construction and destruction of new containers enables a useful performance 
    optimization of complex algorithms processing large numbers of elements. It is well known that 
    in some algorithms <code>std::vector</code> can outperform any other container, including a container 
    based on a B+ tree. If this is the case, then a complex algorithm can take advantage of the fast 
    conversions between an array based B+ tree and <code>std::vector</code>, and run the most efficient 
    variant of a sub-algorithm using <code>std::vector</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>The benefit of the method of the conversion to <code>std::vector</code> depends on the specific 
    details of a user algorithm. In this section, it is illustrated for two sort algorithms supported by 
    the array based B+ trees.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>sort_tree()</code> function of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> implements sorting 
    through single <code>erase()</code> of original elements of a sequence and <code>insert()</code> of these 
    elements into an ordered container. The <code>sort_vector()</code> function converts a sequence based on 
    an array based B+ tree to <code>std::vector</code>, applies to this temporary container 
    <code>std::sort()</code> and then refills the tree based sequence with ordered elements.
    </p>

    <p>This table shows values of running times in milliseconds of the two different implementations of 
    the sort functions, the test function <code>PerformanceTest::test_sort()</code>, 
    the file &quot;perform_tests.hpp&quot;. 
    </p>

    <table border=1 cellpadding="8" frame="box">    
    <caption><code>sort()</code> <i>N</i> elements</caption>
    <tr>
        <td><i>N</i></td>
        <td align="right">1,000</td>
        <td align="right">10,000</td>
        <td align="right">100,000</td>
        <td align="right">1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>sort_tree()</code></td>
        <td align="right">1.0</td>
        <td align="right">11.0</td>
        <td align="right">120.0</td>
        <td align="right">1700.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>sort_vector()</code></td>
        <td align="right">0.12</td>
        <td align="right">1.3</td>
        <td align="right">17.0</td>
        <td align="right">200.0</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
  <br />  

    <p>The high efficiency of <code>std::vector</code> makes the <code>sort_vector()</code> function about 
    eight times faster despite two additional conversion operations between different types of containers. 
    </p>
    

    <h3>Array based B+ trees as enhanced allocators 
    </h3>  
    
    <p>The array based B+ trees of this project have a number of properties that make them similar to 
    pool allocators [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>]. This type of C++ allocator is frequently used to 
    improve performance of dynamically allocated data structures, such as linked lists or red black trees.
    </p>

    <p>For the discussion in this section, it is important to note that a pool allocator represents 
    a simple linked list of memory blocks. An array based B+ tree has basically the same structure of 
    the deepest level when the number of container elements is relatively small. The tree constructs and 
    stores arrays of light nodes with container elements in contiguous regions of large memory blocks. 
    The memory size of every light node is fixed. The arrays are connected through internal parent nodes of 
    the deepest level. As a user algorithm adds new elements, the complexity of the structure of the B+ tree 
    increases. It constructs new levels of internal nodes in order to deliver the best possible performance 
    of container operations. 
    </p>

    <p>The dynamics of memory blocks and elements stored in an array based B+ tree and in a pool allocator 
    are identical. A B+ tree allocates large memory blocks and uses them to control the lifetime of container 
    elements. The elements are created and destroyed in the memory space owned by the tree. The lifetime of 
    a memory block on average is significantly greater than that of a container element. If the total number of 
    elements in a memory block does not exceed its capacity limit, the block can be used to construct and 
    destroy an unlimited number of container elements before the block is freed. 
    </p>

    <p>The array based B+ trees implement customized allocations and deallocations of single container elements, 
    which are more efficient than those provided by general C++ operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>. 
    At the same time, these trees minimize the frequency of system allocations and deallocations of memory blocks 
    that store arrays of nodes with container elements. This method reduces the total cost of memory management 
    for container operations and improves performance of user algorithms that insert and erase large numbers of 
    elements. 
    </p>

    <p>Because of these structural and dynamical properties, an array based B+ tree represents an enhanced 
    and optimized allocator. Alternatively, an array based B+ tree can be regarded as a data structure that 
    implements functionality of an allocator using its own memory space. Regardless of the terminology, 
    the level of integration of memory management in the array based B+ trees is higher than in dynamically 
    allocated variants of these trees that conform to the STL approach for containers and allocators. 
    </p>

    <p>There is, however, one important difference in the memory management between an array based B+ tree 
    and a pool allocator. An allocator designed to work with a dynamically allocated data structure normally 
    stores a node with a container element in a memory region that is not changed for the whole lifetime of 
    the node. This approach improves the safety of algorithms using pointer based iterators. The current 
    implementation of the array based B+ trees does not support this approach. These trees are optimized 
    for the best performance through the contiguous arrangement of container elements in memory blocks. 
    For this reason, update operations can move container elements inside memory blocks to avoid gaps and 
    minimize memory fragmentation. 
    </p>


    <h3>Efficient splice methods extending move semantics 
    </h3>  

    <p>Dynamically allocated doubly linked lists provide various efficient splice operations through 
    the change of the connectivity between a few nodes only. The <code>splice()</code> functions of 
    <code>std::list</code> have constant computational cost except for the one function 
    </p>

    <pre>
    void splice(iterator pos, list& x, iterator first, iterator last);
</pre>

    <p>which has linear cost. The relinking operations are not responsible for the high cost of this 
    function. The inefficiency is caused by counting of inserted and removed elements and updating sizes 
    of modified lists. This implementation complies to the C++ standard requirement that the 
    <code>size()</code> function of <code>std::list</code> has constant cost. 
    </p>

    <p>The array based B+ trees support the <code>splice()</code> functions conforming to the C++ standard 
    with an important difference that all of them have logarithmic computational cost. These functions 
    are a bit less efficient than the constant cost <code>splice()</code> functions of <code>std::list</code>. 
    However, unlike linked lists, the array based B+ trees do not have the problem of linear inefficiency, 
    since they count the number of moved elements in constant time using random access iterators. 
    </p>

    <p>The STL <code>splice()</code> functions of new B+ trees have been implemented through algorithms 
    that join and split trees. The implementation of these algorithms takes advantage of the relatively 
    simple level linked structure of the augmented B+ trees. Every level of these trees represents 
    a doubly linked list. A structural modification of join or split is first applied to every horizontal 
    list of the tree. After that, another algorithm tests every level of the B+ tree and, if required, 
    restores the local balance of groups of child nodes that are adjacent to a node of either the join or 
    cut operation. Since these algorithms are applied to all levels of a B+ tree, the basic implementation 
    functions that join and split trees have logarithmic computational cost. 
    </p>

    <p>For doubly linked lists, the efficient splice operations are possible only if all involved containers 
    store their elements in the same memory space. If this is not the case, user algorithms have only one 
    method of inserting elements into a destination container and erasing these elements from a source 
    container. This is a less efficient method, since it has linear cost. Allocator per container class 
    represents the most practical memory management method for STL containers supporting the efficient splice 
    operations. An array based B+ tree implements memory management methods not only for container elements 
    and nodes, but also for large blocks of uninitialized memory. The allocation and deallocation of these 
    blocks can use a wide variety of methods, from custom allocators to standard methods, such as C++ operators 
    <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[] </code> or C functions <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>splice()</code> functions of the augmented B+ trees belong to the group of functions of 
    efficient structural modifications. They offer an important and fully general extension of STL move 
    semantics, since they can move any range of consecutive elements with logarithmic computational cost 
    in the worst case. This level of generality and efficiency is not achievable with move semantics based on 
    <code>std::list</code>. Its <code>splice()</code> function for an arbitrary range of consecutive elements 
    has linear running time, which is the same as that of copy semantics. 
    </p>

    <p>The <code>splice()</code> and <code>swap()</code> functions of the array based B+ trees support 
    move semantics only. Copy semantics is not implemented in these functions, since it is inefficient. 
    In addition to this, any function with two different semantics can confuse users. A programming solution 
    that is safe under the assumption of copy semantics can have undefined behavior with move semantics 
    due to destructive modification of source objects. 
    </p>
    
   
    <h3>Efficient split with move semantics    
    </h3>  

    <p>The STL interface of sequence containers does not include a function to directly and efficiently 
    split sequences using move semantics. These functions are important for optimization of divide and 
    conquer algorithms. They are also useful in processing of strings and texts. 
    </p>

    <p>Since the number of elements before and after splice operations remains the same, the result of 
    a split operation can be easily obtained using an empty sequence. The following pseudo code shows 
    how to split a sequence using the efficient <code>splice()</code> function with move semantics. 
    </p>

    <pre>
    Sequence              seqce_a ;
    Sequence              seqce_b ;
    ...

    // seqce_a contains N elements 
    // seqce_b is empty 
    Sequence::iterator    mid_a = seqce_a.begin() + N/2 ;  
    Sequence::iterator    end_a = seqce_a.end() ;
    Sequence::iterator    end_b = seqce_b.end() ;

    seqce_b . splice ( end_b, seqce_a, mid_a, end_a ) ; 

    // seqce_a contains first N/2 elements of original sequence
    // seqce_b contains last  N/2 elements of original sequence
</pre>

    <p>The <code>splice()</code> is a member function of a sequence only. It involves a join 
    operation that does not preserve the order of container elements. For this reason both join 
    and splice operations cannot be applied to associative containers in the general case. 
    On the other hand, the split operation does not change the order of elements in obtained 
    containers. This fact implies that the efficient split operations are safe in algorithms 
    using both sequences and associative containers.
    </p>

    <p>The efficient <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code> functions have been already used 
    at the implementation level of the array based B+ trees to improve performance of interface member 
    functions of containers. The use of these functions will be most likely extended in future versions 
    of array based B+ trees and STL variants of containers. 
    </p>


    <h3>Invalidation of random access iterators 
    </h3>  

    <p>The previously developed variants of dynamically allocated B+ trees provide interface functions 
    to deal with the most typical problems of the invalidation of random access iterators 
    <a href="iterators.html">Random access iterators</a>. These functions are not required by 
    the C++ standard, but they are efficient and very helpful in practical applications. 
    </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, in the array based B+ trees, the support of these functions is quite limited 
    and, thus, has been dropped. In addition to general and fundamental problems, random access 
    iterators of array based B+ trees have a number of specific problems. The main disadvantage of 
    the pointer arithmetic is the fact that a pointer to a container element is not as safe after 
    update operations as in dynamically allocated data structures. 
    </p>

    <p>The current implementation of array based B+ trees stores consecutive container elements 
    in contiguous memory regions. Thus, update operations can move container elements inside a memory 
    block in order to avoid gaps. In addition to this, the implementation functions can split and merge 
    memory blocks. A split operation creates a new block and reallocates a group of container elements 
    into the new block. A merge operation reallocates a group of container elements from one block 
    into another and then deletes the first block. In contrast to dynamically allocated B+ trees, 
    these operations make a pointer to an element unsafe not only for <code>erase()</code>, 
    but also for <code>insert()</code> functions. 
    </p>

    <p>One of the most complex and non-trivial cases, in which to find and fix the problem, is 
    the following one. A container returns a memory block to a system and later obtains the same block 
    from the system. In this case, a pointer with an address from this block at first becomes invalid 
    and then valid again. However, it is valid only at the implementation level of a programming solution. 
    The problem with this pointer is that in the end it points most likely to a new container element. 
    In the general case, a pointer of an iterator cannot be used to detect the invalidation problem 
    and re-store a valid state of the iterator. 
    </p>

    <p>A pointer based iterator is often used in algorithms as a simple and low cost ID of a container 
    element supported by a system. Due the effect of <code>erase()</code> functions, this method of 
    element identification is not perfect not only for array based, but also for dynamically allocated 
    data structures <a href="iterators.html">Random access iterators</a>. The main problem of pointer 
    based solutions comes from the fact that a pointer value is not under the control of a user algorithm, 
    but is under the control of a system. For the best possible reliability, these solutions should 
    implement application specific methods of element identification. 
    </p>

    <p>STL variants of containers enable programming solutions to take advantage of a general mathematical 
    concept of a sequence. In contrast to a pointer, an index of an iterator is system independent, 
    since it represents a well defined mathematical object. This is why an index to an element is safe 
    to use in any user algorithm with the only restriction of being in a valid range. The array based 
    B+ trees implement mapping of an index to a container element into a system specific pointer to a node 
    storing the element. This is the same method that has been used for iterators of dynamically allocated 
    B+ trees.
    </p>


    <h3>Conclusion
    </h3>  

    <p>One of the key differences between dynamically allocated and array based B+ trees of this project 
    can be briefly formulated as follows. Dynamically allocated data structures require a pointer machine 
    and provide efficient sequential and random access to container elements. In some aspect, these 
    data structures implement the pointer arithmetic. Array based B+ trees use the pointer arithmetic 
    provided by a system.
    </p>

    <p>The array based B+ trees implement a general and portable partition of an array into a list of 
    sub-arrays connected to a B-tree. These data structures take advantage of the pointer arithmetic 
    and deliver significantly better performance for many container operations against equivalent variants of 
    dynamically allocated trees. 
    </p>

    <p>These trees maximize locality of reference by storing consecutive container elements in contiguous 
    memory regions, minimizing the use of space and taking control of the lifetime of the elements 
    in memory space owned by a tree. These data structures apply the method of sub-array processing 
    instead of less efficient processing by single elements and offer the advantage of the fast conversion to 
    <code>std::vector</code>. The array based B+ trees extend move semantics for STL containers by providing 
    efficient splice and split methods to insert and remove any range of consecutive elements. However, 
    as with many array based data structures, the performance benefit comes at the expense of the 
    invalidation of random access iterators by update operations.
