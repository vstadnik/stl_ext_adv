    <p>This section provides a brief discussion of the properties and implementation 
    details of B+ trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>. It aims to help 
    programmers to better understand the specifics of new containers and how to use 
    them in algorithms.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of B+ trees
    </h3>  
    <p>A B+ tree is a data structure, which supports efficient search, retrieval and 
    update operations of stored information. A B+ tree can be regarded as an improved 
    variant of a B-tree, which was originally developed for systems with external 
    storage [<a href="bibliography.html">2</a>]. 
    </p>
    <p>The main problem of these B-trees is their inefficiency in range queries and 
    sequential processing of data. In a B-tree representing a sorted list a tree 
    traversal algorithm, which finds a next element, in the worst case visits 
    <i>O(log N)</i> nodes at different levels of the tree. Crossing levels in these 
    trees has a very high cost due to a huge difference in access time between 
    the disks and RAM.
    </p>
    <p>For B-trees in main memory, as well as for red-black trees, the cost of crossing 
    levels is significantly lower than in external storage trees and sequential processing 
    is relatively fast. Nevertheless, the structure of nodes remains the same and some 
    adjacent elements of a sorted list are connected through a path of length <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    Thus, sequential processing in these trees is less efficient than in linear data 
    structures, which guarantee that an algorithm can move to the next or previous 
    element in constant time. 
    </p>
    <p>A B+ tree solves these efficiency problems by combining two data structures with 
    different properties. User data are stored in a linear structure such as a linked list, 
    which implements simple and efficient sequential access to the data. The other data 
    structure is a B-tree, which is connected to the linear structure. This tree stores only 
    keys and supports fast search and random access to the data.
    </p>
    <p>In systems for external searching B+ trees can have very complex structures; 
    for example, one node can implement another data structure such as a binary search tree. 
    A B+ tree designed to work in main memory can be implemented as a dynamically allocated 
    data structure with the complexity reduced to minimal in order to support required 
    algorithms and interfaces only. All B+ trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> 
    are level-linked variants of this data structure, 
    for more details see [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>] and below. 
    Level-linked B+ trees are particularly attractive for the development of new STL 
    variants of containers, since they can be implemented in RAM using simple linear 
    topologies of linked lists not only for external nodes, but also for any other level 
    of a tree. Thus, algorithms gain the advantage of efficient access to data stored 
    in both external and internal nodes.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of internal and external nodes
    </h3>
    <p>The implementation of a B+ tree requires different types of nodes, since user data 
    are stored only in external nodes arranged into a linear data structure. In B+ trees 
    of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> an external node is represented by a type, 
    which is named light node. A node of this type stores the minimum of required data: 
    a container element and three links to neighbour nodes. An internal node is represented 
    by a heavy node. A node of this type contains four links to support a level-linked 
    variant of a B+ tree and special implementation data, which improve the performance 
    of algorithms. Instead of a key, a heavy node stores a pointer to a light node. 
    This pointer is used both for connectivity and for access to a container element.
    </p>
    <p>The name heavy node has been selected, since a node of this type stores more 
    information than a light node. Nevertheless, in applications it is possible that a 
    light node requires more space than a heavy node. The size of a light node depends 
    on the size of a container element stored in the node, whereas the size of a heavy 
    node is constant, since this node includes only a pointer to a light node.
    </p>
    <h3>Connectivity of nodes
    </h3>
    <p>The B+ trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> are implemented as 
    multi-linked data structures using a representation similar to leftmost child, 
    right sibling representation of a multi-way tree. Each internal node of these B+ trees 
    contains four links pointing to its right sibling, left sibling, parent and leftmost 
    child. This connectivity arranges the children of each node into a doubly linked list 
    and gives the advantage of simple and fast sequential access to data in these nodes. 
    External nodes, which are children of an internal node, are also arranged into a 
    doubly linked list. Unlike internal nodes, external nodes do not contain redundant 
    links to children; however, they support links to parents. This type of link improves 
    the efficiency of the bottom up processing, which updates cached algorithmic data in 
    internal nodes, when a tree is modified. An internal node can be a parent to the 
    children, which are a group of either internal or external nodes. In the latter case, 
    a link to the leftmost child is supported through a pointer to an external node, which 
    is also used to obtain a value of a container element.    
    </p>                
    <h3>Balance
    </h3>
    <p>For a B+ tree with a minimum degree of a node <i>t</i> (<i>t</i> >= 2) the bounds 
    on the number of children are defined and implemented as follows. Each internal node 
    can have at most 2<i>t</i> children and at least <i>t</i> children. The number of 
    children for an internal node can be less than <i>t</i> if this node is the root, 
    including the case when the total number of user elements stored in external nodes 
    is also less than <i>t</i>.    
    </p>                
    
    <h3>Space requirement
    </h3>
    
    <p>
    This analysis can help estimate the memory consumption of the B+ trees of 
    the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>. The obtained values of the space 
    consumption can be compared with the values for other data structures to make 
    the best choice of a data structure for a user algorithm. 
    </p>                
    <p>
    The space requirement <code>sz_total</code> for a B+ trees of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code> is defined by the formula:     
    </p>           
    <pre>
    sz_total = n_elems * sz_node_ext + n_int_nodes * sz_node_int ;     
    </pre>
    <p>
    here <code>n_elems</code> is the number of elements of a container stored 
    in external nodes of a B+ tree. The number of internal nodes <code>n_int_nodes</code> 
    in the asymptotic limit is given by the sum of the geometric progression: 
    </p>                
    <pre>
	n_int_nodes = n_elems / ( n_children - 1 ) ; 
    </pre>        
    <p>
    For the worst case analysis the parameter <code>n_children</code> should be equal to 
    the minimum degree of a B+ tree <i>t</i>. For the average value of <code>n_int_nodes</code> 
    the parameter <code>n_children</code> is equal to ( <i>t</i> + 2<i>t</i> ) / 2 = 1.5<i>t</i>. 
    </p>                
    <p>    
    The size of an external node <code>sz_node_ext</code> is the same for every 
    variant of the B+ trees:    
    </p>
    <pre>
    sz_node_ext = sz_element + 3*sz_pointer ;
    </pre>        
    <p>
    The size of an internal node <code>sz_node_int</code> is specific to a B+ tree variant. 
    In the current version of the library <code>container_bptree</code> it has the following values:     
    </p>    
    <pre>
    sz_node_int_bp_tree         = 5*sz_pointer + sz_size_t ;
    sz_node_int_bp_tree_idx     = sz_node_int_bp_tree ;
    sz_node_int_bp_tree_idx_acc = sz_node_int_bp_tree_idx + sz_element ;
    </pre>    
    <p>
    here:    
    </p>
    <pre>
    sz_element - the size of a type of a container element,
    sz_pointer - the size of a pointer,
    sz_size_t  - the size of the type size_t .
    </pre>    
    <p>
    For practical estimates of the space requirement for a B+ tree of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code> the following simplified model can be used. The minimum value 
    can be obtained using the space consumption of external nodes only: 
    <code>sz_total = n_elem*sz_node_ext</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    For the second approximation the number of internal nodes can be set <code>0.1*n_elems</code>, 
    since on average one internal node has <code>n_children = (8+16)/2 = 12</code>. Thus, the improved 
    value of the space consumption can be calculated by the formula:    
    </p>
    <pre>
    sz_total = n_elems * ( sz_node_ext + 0.1 * sz_node_int ) ;    
    </pre> 
    <p>
    here the value of <code>sz_node_int</code> is specific to a B+ tree as discussed above.     
    </p>
    <p>
    The increase in the space consumption <code>sz_augment</code> for the support of a new augmenting 
    data element that is added to internal nodes only can be also estimated using ten per cent factor 
    for the number of internal nodes:     
    </p>
    <pre>
    sz_augment = 0.1 * n_elems * sz_aug_elem ;  
    </pre>
    <p>
    here <code>sz_aug_elem</code> is the size of a type of an augmenting data element.     
    </p>
    <p>
    The effect of the increased space requirement on the performance of the augmented B+ trees 
    of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> is discussed in the document 
    <a href="performance.html">Performance of basic algorithms</a>, the section 
    &quot;Effect of augmenting on performance of B+ trees&quot;. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Level-linked structure
    </h3>
    <p>In a B+ tree all external nodes have the same depth. This property makes a B+ tree 
    globally balanced and allows the modification of the structure, which is known as a 
    level-linked B+ tree [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>]. A B+ tree of this type 
    arranges internal nodes of one level into a linked list.
    </p>                
    <p>In current implementation of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>, in order to 
    make a B+ tree level-linked, it is sufficient to connect the rightmost internal node 
    of a child group with the leftmost internal node of the next child group at the same 
    level. The deepest level of the tree is a doubly linked list with user data stored in 
    external nodes. Thus, the whole data structure looks like a set of parallel horizontal 
    linked lists. Note also that, formally, level-linked B+ trees are graphs.
    </p>
    <p>Level-linked connectivity provides algorithms the advantage of efficient sequential 
    access to internal nodes and to data stored in these nodes at every level of the tree. 
    It reduces the maximum cost of visiting a neighbour node at the same level from 
    <i>O(log N)</i> using a tree traversal algorithm to <i>O(1)</i> using a level link.
    </p>
    <p>As an algorithm moves up the tree, the number of nodes in every level decreases with 
    the mean frequency 3<i>t</i>/2. At the same time, the number of external nodes with 
    container elements connected to an internal node through child-parent links increases 
    by the same factor. Thus, an algorithm can use the upper levels of the tree in order to 
    vary the length and precision of the data iteration step between two internal nodes of 
    the same level.
    </p>
    <h3>Data scheme
    </h3>
    <p>One of the attractive properties of B+ trees is a high degree of freedom in choosing 
    formats and specific implementation data, which can be stored in internal nodes, in order 
    to improve the performance of search algorithms. This property allows various schemes of 
    data association with internal nodes, leaving an unmodified structure of external nodes 
    with user information. In particular, some variants of B+ trees for external searching 
    store small size keys, which are not necessarily exact values of corresponding data. This 
    approach increases the amount of information stored in internal nodes, reduces the frequency 
    of disk read operations and thus improves performance of these systems. Although the choice 
    of a data scheme has some effect on the space usage, it does not change the theoretical limit 
    of the space requirement to store a B+ tree, which is <i>O(N)</i>. Balanced B+ trees grow 
    and contract in the same way regardless of a specific data scheme.    
    </p>                            
    <p>The B+ trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> are designed to extend 
    functionality of search trees. This is why, in contrast to space optimized search trees, 
    internal nodes of these B+ trees store additional implementation data, which are used by 
    new algorithms. The new functionality and improved efficiency are achieved at the cost of 
    the increased space requirement.
    </p>
    <p>The other feature of the selected data scheme, which also results in an additional space 
    usage, is a partial duplication of data in internal nodes, since a parent node and its 
    leftmost child point to the same node and container element in a list of external nodes. 
    This data scheme particularly suits well the level-linked structure of B+ trees of the 
    namespace <code>container_bptree</code>. It is probably a bit simpler for the implementation 
    of STL variants of containers and algorithms than the standard data scheme used in 
    search B and B+ trees [<a href="bibliography.html">2</a>]. 
    </p>
    <p>Storing additional data in internal nodes and hence losing space is justified only if 
    this can make an improvement to an algorithm. The first means by which the B+ trees of 
    the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> improve performance is that they store only those 
    data, which make redundant calculations and re-calculations of data used by an algorithm. 
    This method applies the technique, which is described in [<a href="bibliography.html">4</a>], 
    see the chapter &quot;Augmenting Data Structures&quot;. The second means is the use of efficient access 
    to the pre-calculated data through the level-linked structure of a B+ tree.
    </p>
    <p>In every B+ tree of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> an internal node contains 
    a data member, which is a counter of the nodes of the tree. This counter has different 
    purposes in these data structures. 
    </p>
    <p>In the class <code>bp_tree</code> this datum represents the number of children, which 
    can be a group of either internal or external nodes. 
    </p>
    <p>In the classes <code>bp_tree_idx</code> and <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> this counter 
    represents the number of external nodes with user elements stored in a container. For internal 
    nodes the value of this parameter in a parent node is equal to the sum of counters stored in 
    its children. For the deepest level of internal nodes this parameter represents the number of 
    children in a group of external nodes. This detail is useful to improve the performance of 
    methods, which modify trees of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The values of the counters of container elements, which are stored in internal nodes, reflect 
    the structural relationships between the nodes of the tree. These values are independent of 
    specific user data stored in the nodes of the tree. An algorithm can efficiently obtain and update 
    these counters using links between nodes of the tree. The counters data along with the connectivity 
    of nodes can be regarded as an independent substructure of indices. This substructure provides 
    efficient support for algorithms, which require an index value of a container element, and for 
    random access iterators.
    </p>                
    <p>STL variants of containers based on the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> support the 
    efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>, which has computational cost <i>O(log N)</i> 
    in the worst case. This performance has been achieved by adding to every internal node a 
    new datum, which represents a sum of consecutive elements stored in external nodes. For the 
    deepest level of internal nodes a parent stores a sum of values of the container elements of 
    its external child nodes. For all other levels of the internal nodes of the tree every parent 
    stores a sum, which is equal to a sum of sum values stored in its children. When an algorithm 
    moves up the tree from a child to its parent, it obtains a sum value of a quickly increasing 
    number of container elements stored in external nodes.

    </table>
    <p>
    Unlike the substructure of indices, the substructure of sums depends on the values of 
    container elements stored in the external nodes of the tree. However, specific values of 
    sum data in internal nodes are also affected by the structural relationship between nodes. 
    For this reason, the substructures of indices and sums have a very close similarity. In the 
    case when each element of a container has the value 1, these two substructures become identical. 
    In this respect, the substructure of sums supersedes the substructures of indices.
    </p>
    <p>The ability of the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> to simultaneously support two 
    substructures of two data sets associated with container elements enables the development 
    of more efficient algorithms and solutions. For examples using both index and sum substructures, 
    see the discussion of the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> in the next section 
    &quot;Basic Algorithms&quot;  and the discussion regarding the calculation of the mean value 
    in the section <a href="containers.html">Classes of containers and B+ trees</a>. 
    </p>
    <h3>Basic Algorithms
    </h3>
    <p>
    In every B+ tree of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> insert and erase methods 
    for a single element are typical bottom up algorithms, which have computational cost 
    <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case [<a href="bibliography.html">2</a>]. 
    The only specific requirements to these methods are that they must maintain valid algorithm 
    data stored in internal nodes as described in [<a href="bibliography.html">4</a>]. 
    Search methods are top down algorithms with the same logarithmic cost.
    </p>                
    <p>The class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> implements the algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>, 
    which has logarithmic computational cost in the worst case. This algorithm is basically a finger 
    search [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>], which takes advantage of the level-linked structure of this B+ tree. The start and 
    end positions of container elements are specified by two input iterators, which provide pointers 
    to corresponding external nodes. The algorithm uses a substructure of indices in order to find 
    between these two external nodes a path, which has the minimum or close to the minimum number 
    of edges. For distant external nodes the path goes through internal nodes, which store 
    pre-calculated sums of container elements. The required sum of consecutive elements is obtained 
    by summing up values of elements in external nodes and cached sum values in internal nodes 
    when this algorithm moves to a next node at the same level of a tree or, in other words, passes 
    through a horizontal link.
    </p>
    <p>Note that one implementation of the member function <code>bp_tree_idx_acc::accumulate()</code> 
    supports all STL variants of containers: ordered and unordered, with unique and multiple values 
    of elements. This implementation is generic, because it takes advantage of the substructure of 
    efficient indexing, which maps non-negative integers into container elements. Thus, at the 
    implementation level of this efficient algorithm any container is processed as a sequence. 
    This algorithm is yet another demonstration of the powerful potential and effectiveness of the 
    concept of a sequence in the practically important area of the support of STL containers and 
    algorithms.
    </p>     
    <p>The finger search algorithm has cost <i>O(log D)</i>, where <i>D</i> is the number of 
    consecutive container elements. This cost is better than the cost of a tree search, which 
    is <i>O(log N)</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of container elements. This fact makes the 
    alternative search based algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> less efficient than the finger 
    search algorithm. However, performance is not the main reason why this algorithm has been 
    selected to implement the fast member function <code>accumulate()</code>. For practical 
    applications, it is very important to calculate a sum of elements with the best possible 
    accuracy. The finger search algorithm provides the accuracy, which is practically the same as 
    that of standard algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>, which sums up values of container 
    elements in a sequential order.
