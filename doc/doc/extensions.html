    <p>The C++ standard library [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>] has proven to be very effective 
    in the development of various programming solutions. The success of this library is due to its 
    solid theoretical framework and high quality of design. One of the key features of this library 
    is that many types of containers represent specialized and optimized variants of a sequence, 
    which is one of the most fundamental mathematical concepts widely used to solve problems in 
    numerous application areas. The choice of a specific computer representation of a sequence 
    is critical for achieving the best possible structure and efficiency of user solutions. 
    </p>        
    <p>The namespace <code>container_bptree</code> offers a number of STL variants of containers 
    based on B+ trees [<a href="bibliography.html">2</a>]. These trees have the same theoretical 
    performance in terms of search and update operations as other types of search trees. 
    The main advantage of B+ trees is that they provide more efficient sequential access to data. 
    This feature itself makes these data structures quite attractive for use in various types of containers. 
    In addition to this, the basic search B+ trees can be augmented as any other data structure 
    in order to support new algorithms and improve the performance of existing algorithms. 
    The increased computational power of the augmented data structures enables the development of 
    containers and iterators with new functionality, as well as new more efficient general algorithms. 
    The library <code>container_bptree</code> offers the following advantages and extensions of 
    STL facilities: 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>A generalized and unified computer representation of sequences of many types: ordered and 
        unordered, containing unique and multiple elements, with bidirectional and random access 
        iterators. In particular, one augmented data structure can efficiently support specialized 
        STL sequences (<code>vector</code>, <code>deque</code>, <code>list</code>) and STL variants of 
        associative containers (<code>set</code>, <code>mulitset</code>, <code>map</code>, 
        <code>miltimap</code>) with random access iterators. 
    <li>The random access iterators of containers of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> 
        implement multi-purpose and efficient extensions of STL iterators. An iterator of this type 
        can be used in algorithms as a pointer and an index to an element of a container. 
        These random access iterators can effectively address the fundamental problem of 
        the iterator invalidation and improve the reliability of user algorithms in a similar way 
        to bidirectional iterators of a list. 
    <li>The function <code>accumulate()</code> with logarithmic computational complexity can 
        significantly improve performance of many practically important algorithms and applications, 
        such as the numerical integration, the statistics, the data analysis etc. 
    <li>The generalized STL variants of containers and iterators of the namespace 
        <code>container_bptree</code> offer the advantage of the development of more 
        general solutions and extend the application area of STL. 
        They complement and can replace in algoritms the specialized STL containers 
        with reduced interfaces, less efficient member functions and bidirectional iterators. 
    </ul>
    
    <p>The C++ standard library specifies interfaces of container types and allows various 
    implementation alternatives, including choice of the most suitable data structures. 
    The development of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> demonstrates that B+ trees 
    not only support, but also extend the facilities of STL. Compared to other data structures, 
    B+ trees have important practical advantages in this application area. This class of data 
    structures is one of the most thoroughly studied at present. There are many implementations 
    of B+ trees, which gain from specific system optimizations. These optimized B+ trees 
    have a great potential in achieving the best possible performance and a high level of 
    generality of programming solutions, which is one of the design principles of 
    STL [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>].
