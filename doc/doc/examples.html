    <p>This section includes a number of practically useful applications of new data 
    structures and algorithms of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>. These 
    applications are less trivial than the calculation of the mean value discussed in 
    the previous section. Despite the complications, the new containers help develop 
    effective and relatively simple solutions. The aim of this section is to show 
    how to reduce the complexity of solutions in specific applications.
    </p>
    <p>In order to simplify the demo code and focus on the main features of algorithms 
    using new data structures, the data members of classes specific to problem domains 
    are of type <code>int</code>. The algorithms operating with integral types take 
    advantage of precise values and use relational and equality operators without 
    a tolerance parameter. In practical applications, data types and operations 
    can be parameterized to support generic solutions.

    <h3>Fast counting of intersections of one interval with sequence of intervals 
    </h3>  
    <p>The example in file &quot;interval.cpp&quot; demonstrates how to use new associative 
    containers with random access iterators to find the total number of intersections 
    between an input interval and a sequence of intervals. 
    </p>
    <p>The main advantage of the algorithm developed for this example is its low computational cost. 
    It finds any number of intersections in <i>O(log N)</i> time, where <i>N</i> is the number of 
    intervals in a sequence. Note that this algorithm does not return a result list with all 
    intersected intervals. This is a different problem. An algorithm for this problem has 
    the computational cost of at least the number of intersections, which can be much greater 
    than <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>The algorithm of this example has been developed for semi-open intervals with 
    endpoints <code>[a, b)</code>, <code>a<=b</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>
    class Interval 
    {
    public:
        explicit 
        Interval ( int  _a=0 , int  _b=0 ) : a ( _a ) , b ( _b ) 
        {
            if ( b < a ) std::swap ( a , b ) ; 
        }         
        
        int     A ( ) const { return a ; } 
        int     B ( ) const { return b ; } 

    private:
        int     a ; 
        int     b ; 
    } ;    
</pre>
    <p>The type <code>VectInterval</code> 
    </p>
    <pre>
    typedef std::vector&lt;Interval&gt;   VectInterval ;
</pre> 
    <p>represents a collection of intervals. In generic algorithms a collection, such as 
    <code>VectInterval</code>, can store either unordered or ordered objects of any size 
    and any type, provided that each object represents an interval. 
    </p>
    <p>In order to test the correctness of the new efficient algorithm, the example 
    includes linear algorithm of counting of intersections of intervals 
    </p>
    <pre>
    int  CountIntersections 
    ( 
        Interval const &        interval_x  , 
        VectInterval const &    vect_interval
    ) ;
</pre>
    <p>For the method of linear counting, a result of the intersection of two arbitrary 
    intervals is determined by the function: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    bool Intersect ( Interval const &  x , Interval const &  y ) 
    {
        return ( x.A() < y.B() ) && ( y.A() < x.B() ) ; 
    }
</pre>
    <p>The method of fast counting of all intersections between an input interval and a sequence 
    of intervals is based on a simple fact. The total number of intervals in the sequence is 
    equal to the sum of two numbers of intervals that intersect and do not intersect input 
    interval <code>x</code>. For semi-open intervals with endpoints <code>[a, b)</code>, 
    the total number of intersections <code>n_x</code> can be calculated by the formula: 
    </p>
    <pre>
	n_x = n - n_a - n_b ;     
</pre>
    <p>where <code>n</code> is the total number of intervals in the sequence, <code>n_a</code> 
    is the number of intervals in the sequence with upper endpoint <code>b</code> 
    such that <code>( i.b <= x.a )</code>, <code>n_b </code> is the number of intervals in 
    the sequence with lower endpoint <code>a</code> such that <code>( i.a >= x.b )</code>. 
    Both <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> are the numbers of intervals that do not 
    intersect input interval <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The efficiency of this method is defined by the efficiency of the calculation of values of 
    <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code>, since the total number of intervals in a sequence
    <code>n</code> is obtained in constant time. 
    </p>
    <p>If the intervals and their endpoints are stored in unordered containers, the required numbers 
    <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> can be obtained in linear time only. 
    In order to improve the performance, the method uses two ordered sequences: the first one stores 
    the lower endpoints from every interval, while the second one stores the upper endpoints. 
    The ordered sequences support the search for boundaries of subsets of intervals with 
    logarithmic time. The calculation of <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> through random access 
    iterators pointing to the boundaries of the subsets has constant cost. This is why the performance 
    of this method is logarithmic in the worst case and does not depend on the total number of 
    intersections of intervals. 
    </p>
    <p>The namespace <code>container_bptree</code> offers associative containers with random access 
    iterators required for the implementation of the fast counting of intersections of intervals. 
    The type <code>MultiSet</code> 
    </p>
    <pre>
    typedef container_bptree::multiset&lt;int&gt; MultiSetInt ;    
</pre>
    <p>represents a collection of intervals ordered by the lower or upper endpoint of an interval. 
    In practical applications, a container, such as <code>MultiSet</code>, can store light weight 
    objects associated with heavy weight objects representing intervals.
    </p>
    <p>The STL facilities of the associative containers of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>
    are particularly effective in the fast counting of intersections. These containers support 
    logarithmic search for boundaries of required subsets through member functions 
    <code>lower_bound()</code> and <code>upper_bound()</code> along with constant time counting of
    intervals in these subsets through random access iterators. The efficient algorithm of counting of 
    intersections with logarithmic running time is implemented in the method: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    int  CountIntersections
        (
            Interval const &        interval_x  ,
            MultiSetInt const &     mset_a      ,
            MultiSetInt const &     mset_b
        )
    {
        int     n     = mset_a . size ( ) ;
        int     n_a   = mset_b . upper_bound ( interval_x.A() ) - 
                        mset_b . begin ( ) ;
        int     n_b   = mset_a . end ( ) - 
                        mset_a . lower_bound ( interval_x.B() ) ;
        int     count = n - n_a - n_b ;
        return  count ;
    }
</pre>
    <p>The functionality of the example algorithm of the fast counting of intersections of intervals 
    can be extended for advanced applications. This can be achieved through associative containers 
    of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>, which support both random access iterators and 
    the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. For any required subset of intervals, 
    an algorithm based on these containers can obtain not only the number of intervals, but also 
    the total time, the mean value and standard deviation. The computational cost of obtaining of 
    all of these parameters is logarithmic. 
    </p>
    <h3>Examples using fast algorithm <cod>accumulate()</code> 
    </h3>  
    <p>The rest of this section discusses several practical applications of sequences based on the 
    class <code>bptree_idx_acc</code> of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>. 
    These examples demonstrate that STL variants of containers with random access iterators 
    and the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> provide the most advanced and 
    very efficient facilities for analysis of data. 
    </p>
    <p>The common feature of the examples using fast algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    is the calculation of sums and mean values of several parameters of a sequence of objects. 
    In these applications, the most straightforward method is to create a container with the fast 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> for every parameter to be processed by a user algorithm. 
    </p>
    <p>The examples demonstrate how to solve a problem using only one container for all parameters 
    to be summed up in a user algorithm. In many practical applications, this can be achieved with 
    a user defined type, which stores values of all parameters required in the algorithm. The method 
    based on a single container with a user defined type for all parameters provides at least 
    two advantages: optimized space usage and improved structure of a user algorithm. 
    </p>
    <p>The demo code shows how this method works with containers of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code> using both the efficient and the standard algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. The results of these algorithms are compared to test the 
    correctness of the implementation. 
    </p>
    <p>All example algorithms based on containers of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> 
    with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> have the same theoretical performance. 
    In every example, a value of a sum is calculated in logarithmic time and a number of elements 
    within a specified range - in constant time.     
    </p>
    <h3>Mean values of parameters of rectangles and numerical integration
    </h3>
    <p>
    The code in file "rectangle_area.cpp" demonstrates how to use the fast algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> to calculate sums and mean values of several parameters of 
    a sequence of rectangles: the width, length, perimeter and area. This example includes 
    the numerical integration as a particular case. 
    </p>
    <p>        
    In the group of examples using one container with the efficient summation algorithm, 
    this example is the most advanced and illustrative in terms of implementation details. 
    This is why it is given the most detailed consideration and explanation.
    </p>
    <p>The class <code>RectArea</code> has three data members to store and calculate sums of 
    all required parameters: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    class RectArea 
    {
    ...
        int     width  ; 
        int     length ; 
        int     area   ; 
    } ;
    </pre>
    <p>The width and length of a rectangle must be provided by a user algorithm. The area of 
    the rectangle is calculated automatically using the provided values of the width and length. 
    Storing the area value is an important detail of this programming solution. In many similar 
    applications involving the processing of rectangles, it is sufficient to store in the class 
    <code>Rectangle</code> values of only two independent attributes: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    class Rectangle 
    {
    ...
        double      length ; 
        double      width  ; 
        double      Area ( ) const { return length*width ; } 
    } ;
    </pre>
    <p>The value of the derived attribute area can be calculated in constant time using the length 
    and width of the rectangle. Within this alternative approach, the area value is not stored 
    in order to save space. 
    </p>
    <p>The list of data members of the class <code>RectArea</code> cannot be reduced to two independent 
    parameters only if a user algorithm calculates the sum of areas. In the general case, this value 
    cannot be obtained from the sums of the lengths and widths. On the other hand, the sum and mean 
    value of the perimeter can be calculated using the length and width sums. Thus this parameter 
    does not require a special data member in the class <code>RectArea</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>When specifying the interface of the class <code>RectArea</code>, it is necessary to define 
    a number of arithmetic operators. A B+ tree supporting the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    requires that a user defined type overload the following operators: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    class RectArea 
    {
    ...
        RectArea &  operator += ( const RectArea &  x ) ;
        RectArea &  operator -= ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
        RectArea    operator +  ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
        RectArea    operator -  ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
    } ;
</pre>
    <p>Through these operators, implementation functions of the B+ tree update cached data in 
    internal nodes when the tree is modified and support the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. 
    Overloading four operators is a relatively strict requirement, since the summation of elements 
    with the standard algorithm <code>std::accumulate()</code> requires overloading only one binary 
    <code>operator+</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>The discussed data members and arithmetic operators of the class <code>RectArea</code> meet 
    the minimum requirements for an element of a sequence with the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> for this example. In practical applications, this class can have 
    other data members and interface operations. 
    </p>
    <p>The demo code shows two methods for the calculation of the sums. For efficient calculation with 
    logarithmic running time, a user algorithm should call the member function <code>accumulate()</code>: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    sum_rect_area = seqceRectArea . accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_rect_area_0 ) ;    
</pre>
    <p>The standard algorithm <code>std::accumulate()</code> obtains the same result in linear time: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    sum_rect_area = std::accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_rect_area_0 ) ;    
</pre>
    <p>The second method can be helpful at the development stage of a project to test the correctness 
    of the design and implementation of new classes and algorithms. 
    </p>
    <p>The values of sums of specific parameters of a sequence of rectangles can now be obtained 
    through the interface member functions of the class <code>RectArea</code>: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    sum_width  = sum_rect_area . Width ( ) ; 
    sum_length = sum_rect_area . Length( ) ; 
    sum_area   = sum_rect_area . Area  ( ) ; 
    </pre>
    <p>The number of elements in the range of calculations is obtained in constant time through 
    the distance between random access iterators: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    n = pos_b - pos_a ;     
</pre>
    <p>The mean values of the width, length and area are obtained from the corresponding sums: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    mean_width  = sum_width  / n ;
    mean_length = sum_length / n ;
    mean_area   = sum_area   / n ;
</pre>
    <p>As it has been discussed above the main feature of the selected method is the calculation of 
    several sums using one container with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. 
    Despite only the width and length of a rectangle are independent parameters, the class 
    <code>RectArea</code> has a special data member to store the area too. In contrast to the area 
    calculation, the mean value of the perimeter does not require storing a special sum as a data member 
    of the class <code>RectArea</code>. It can be derived from results obtained for the width and length 
    using their sums or mean values, e.g.: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    mean_perimeter = 2.0 * ( mean_width + mean_length ) ;    
</pre>
    <p>
    This example can be used to implement the rectangle method of the numerical integration 
    of a function. The approximate value of the definite integral is provided by the sum of 
    rectangle areas <code>sum_area</code>. The width of a rectangle is a variable parameter, 
    which means that a user algorithm can sample the function with both equal and variable 
    steps between abscissas of data points. In the simplest cases when all data points are 
    equally spaced it is sufficient to store in a container only area values without using 
    the class <code>RectArea</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The code of this example can be also adapted to support the other widely used integration 
    method of the trapezoidal rule. The high accuracy methods of the numerical integration 
    sum up values of a function multiplied by their weights. The example of the weighted mean 
    value, which is discussed below, shows how the sums can be calculated in logarithmic time 
    instead of linear. 
    </p>        
    <p>
    The important feature of the containers of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> 
    is the low cost of all basic operations. The computer algorithms of the numerical 
    integrations based on these containers can take advantage of the fast update operations 
    in order to efficiently find the best approximation of a function. The insertion of new data 
    points or interpolation points improves the accuracy the approximation. The removal of 
    redundant data points reduces the number of approximation data points and saves space. 
    </p>
    <h3>Mean value and standard deviation 
    </h3>
    <p>The mean value and the standard deviation are key parameters in the statistical analysis of data. 
    Practical applications processing large and huge data sets demand the most efficient algorithms 
    for calculating these parameters. This example shows how to use one container with the efficient 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> to obtain these two important parameters for any consecutive 
    elements of a sequence. 
    </p>
    <p>In this example, see file &quot;standard_deviation.cpp&quot;, the type of an element of 
    a sequence with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> is represented by the class
    <code>ElementValue</code>: 
    </p>
    <pre>
    class ElementValues
    {
    public:
        explicit
        ElementValues ( int v=0 ) ; 

        int     Value ( )        const ; 
        int     ValueSquared ( ) const ;  

        ElementValues &  operator += ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues &  operator -= ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues    operator +  ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues    operator -  ( const ElementValues &  x ) ; 

    private:
        int     value ; 
        int     value_squared ; 
    } ;
</pre>
    <p>This class stores both the value of an element and its squared value. A user algorithm 
    provides only the value of an element. The squared value is calculated and updated automatically 
    through the constructor and operators of this class. 
    </p>
    <p>From an implementation point of view, this example algorithm can be regarded as a simplified 
    variant of the algorithm processing parameters of a sequence of rectangles. In fact, the previous 
    solution can support the calculations of mean and standard deviation values of elements provided 
    that both the width and the length of a rectangle represent the value of an element and the area 
    represents the squared value of the element. 
    </p>
    <p>The example code shows how to obtain the sum of values of elements and the sum of squared values 
    using both the standard and efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. These calculations apply 
    the efficient algorithm:
    </p>
    <pre>
    sum_elem_values = seqce_values . accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_elem_values_0 ) ;
    sum_x           = sum_elem_values . Value ( ) ;
    sum_x_2         = sum_elem_values . ValueSquared ( ) ;
</pre>
    <p>The mean value and standard deviation are derived from the obtained sums and the number of elements:
    </p>
    <pre>
    n         = pos_b - pos_a ; 
    mean      = sum_x/n ; 
    variance  = sum_x_2/n - mean*mean ; 
    deviation = sqrt ( variance ) ;  
</pre>
    <h3>Testing if any consecutive elements are equal 
    </h3>
    <p>The efficient calculation of the mean value and standard deviation provides the following 
    interesting result. The standard deviation is a measure of the distribution of data. If the value of 
    this parameter is zero, then all elements of the sequence have the same value. This conclusion is 
    particularly important for unordered sequences. The calculation of sums of values and squared values 
    has logarithmic cost, see the discussion of basic algorithms in the section 
    <a href="bp_trees.html">Design and implementation of B+ trees</a>. Hence, the efficient 
    calculation of the standard deviation enables the user algorithm to test if any number <i>N</i> 
    of consecutive elements are equal in <i>O(log N)</i> time. 
    </p>
    <p>In practical applications, it is necessary to minimize numerical errors of floating data types. 
    Some improvement can be achieved by eliminating the division by the number of elements from the 
    variance calculations. In this case, the test is reduced to the comparison of the sums of values 
    and squared values: 
    </p>
    <pre>    
    // test if all elements have the same value
    if ( n*sum_x_2 == sum_x*sum_x ) 
    ...
</pre>
    <p>This method can be suitable for integral types and user defined types based on integral types. 
    </p>
    <p>Note also that for ordered sequences, the test if all elements in a range have 
    the same value is trivial. It only compares the values of elements at two specified positions. 
    For a non-empty semi-open range <code>[pos_a, pos_b)</code>, the test is: 
    </p>
    <pre>    
    if ( *pos_a == *(pos_b-1) )
    ...  
</pre>
    <p>This test has constant cost. For an unordered sequence, without the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> the test takes linear time. 
    </p>
    <h3>Weighted mean value
    </h3>
    <p>The weighted mean value is an important characteristic and method for the analysis of large data sets. 
    For histogram data the weight parameter represents a frequency of a value. For a large data set with 
    pre-calculated mean values of subsets the weight represents a number of elements in a data subset. 
    This parameter significantly improves the running time of the calculation of the mean value of the 
    whole data set. With weights and mean values of subsets the time reduces from the total number of 
    elements to the total number of subsets only. The example in file &quot;weighted_mean.cpp&quot; 
    demonstrates how to improve the performance of calculations of the weighted mean value even further 
    using a sequence with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. The running time of this 
    algorithm is logarithmic function of the number of subsets. 
    </p>
    <p>The type of a container element is declared and defined in the class <code>WeightedValue</code>. 
    It includes the three data members to store the value of an element, its weight and contribution, 
    which is defined as the product of the value by its weight: 
    </p>
    <pre>    
    class WeightedValue 
    {
    ...
        int     value  ; 
        int     weight ; 
        int     contribution ; 
    } ;
</pre>
    <p>The value of an element and its weight must be provided by a user algorithm. The contribution of 
    the value is automatically calculated and updated using the value and its weight. 
    </p>
    <p>The comparison shows that this example has a very close similarity with the example of 
    the calculation of the mean values of parameters for a sequence of rectangles. When the length, 
    width and area of a rectangle represent the value, weight and contribution, respectively, of 
    an element, the examples become almost identical. This fact suggests that in practical 
    applications, code reuse can be achieved through the parameterization of algorithms. This fact 
    also allows us to omit the discussion of many implementation details of this example. 
    </p>
    <p>The major specific feature of this example is that the calculation of the weighted mean value 
    uses two accumulated sums of the contributions and weights:     
    </p>
    <pre>    
    mean_weighted = sum_contribution / sum_weight ;
</pre>
    <p>The arithmetic mean value is derived from the sum of all values and the total number of the values. 
    The arithmetic mean is a special case of the weighted mean when every weight is equal to one. However, 
    the total number of elements does not require any special summation, since it can be determined 
    in constant time through random access iterators as discussed above in the example  
    "Mean value and standard deviation". 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is interesting and helpful to compare the performance improvement of the standard and new 
    methods of the weighted mean value in the calculation of the mean value of a data set. 
    For example, if a data set contains <code>1,000,000</code> elements arranged into 
    <code>1,000</code> subsets with pre-calculated mean values, then the standard algorithm 
    improves the performance by the factor <code>1,000</code>. This improvement is substantial 
    for any practical application. The new efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> has logarithmic 
    running time. For this reason its performance improvement is not so significant as for linear 
    algorithms. For the same example, it is <code>log(1,000,000)/log(1,000)</code>, which gives 
    the factor <code>2.0</code>.
