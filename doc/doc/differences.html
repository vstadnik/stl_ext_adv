    <p>The new containers supporting variants of STL interfaces should not take much time 
    to learn how to use in algorithms. It is only necessary to understand how these new 
    containers differ from standard containers. This section provides a list of the most 
    significant non-standard features of interface types of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code> and explains the reasons as to why these features 
    have been implemented.
    </p>
    <p>The current version of submitted classes has reached a relatively high level of consistency 
    with the C++03 standard. Nevertheless, interfaces of container and iterator types of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code> do not completely conform to the requirements of STL containers. 
    The differences, which are discussed in this section, are caused by specific properties of B+ trees 
    of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> and by design decisions, which have been made to 
    improve the consistency of various types of STL sequences. There are a few new member functions 
    as well as a few differences in the signatures of functions and in the computational complexity.
    </p>
    
    <p>1. The library <code>container_bptree</code> supports STL variants of associative containers 
    (<code>set</code>, <code>multiset</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>multimap</code>) 
    with both bidirectional and random access iterators. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>2. The class <code>sequence</code>, which implements a union of interfaces of the three STL 
    classes <code>list</code>, <code>vector</code> and <code>deque</code>, is not a part of the 
    C++ standard. In the current version <code>sequence</code> supports random access iterators only.
    </p>
    <p>3. The <code>sequence</code> member functions <code>capacity()</code> and <code>reserve()</code> 
    implement different behaviour. These two member functions are related to memory management rather 
    than to the properties of a container and its elements. For containers of the namespace 
    <code>container_bptree</code>, which implement dynamically allocated data structures, memory 
    management is a responsibility of allocators.
    </p>
    <p>4. All interface member functions <code>sequence::splice()</code> have different signatures, 
    since these functions invalidate input random access iterators. Each variant of the function 
    <code>splice()</code> returns a valid iterator, which points to the same element as the input 
    iterator, but provides a correct value of the distance to the first element in a container. 
    The current implementations of the functions <code>splice()</code> have in the worst case cost 
    <i>O(NlogN)</i>, which is much higher than that of <code>std::list</code>.  In theory, B+ trees 
    can support these functions with logarithmic cost.
    </p>
    <p>5. Access to <code>sequence</code> elements through the subscript <code>operator[ ]</code> or 
    the member function <code>at()</code> has complexity <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case. The total 
    cost of sequential processing of all container elements through this operator and member function 
    can reach <i>O(N log N)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>For better performance algorithms, which process all or a large number of consecutive container 
    elements, should use sequential access through an iterator, which has cost <i>O(N)</i>. This method 
    also has the advantage of the development of generic solutions, since it can be used not only with 
    <code>sequence</code>, but also with STL variants of associative containers.
    </p>
    <p>6. The operators <code>{+=, -=, +, -}</code>, which change the position of a random access iterator, 
    in the worst case have computational cost <i>O(log N)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>7. Classes of random access iterators include the following member functions to check the states 
    of objects:
    </p>
    <pre>
    bool valid_data()    const ; 
    bool valid_mapping() const ; 
</pre>
    <p>If possible, valid mapping can be restored using the member functions:
    </p>
    <pre>
    void update_index()  ; 
    void update_pointer(); 
</pre>
    <p>It is important to note that the straight forward replacement of STL types in existing C++ code 
    with containers and iterators of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> is not safe in general 
    and should be thoroughly tested. The problems can be caused not only by different signatures of 
    interface member functions of container classes, but also by changing iterator category from 
    bidirectional to random access. In a generic solution a random access iterator can be invalidated by 
    operations, which change the size of a container. The new member functions of iterator classes provide 
    efficient support to deal with these problems. They have logarithmic cost in the worst case. For more 
    details, see the section <a href="iterators.html">Random access iterators</a>.
    </p>
    <p>8. Each STL variant of a container of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code> includes 
    the new member function
    </p>
    <pre>
    value_type  
    accumulate ( const_iterator  pos_start ,
                 const_iterator  pos_end   ,
                 value_type      val_in    ) const ;
</pre>
    <p>These functions implement algorithms, which provide the same result as the STL method 
    <code>std::accumulate()</code>. For the containers based on the class <code>bp_tree_idx_acc</code> 
    this function has computational complexity <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case, while for 
    the two other basic containers it is <i>O(N)</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of consecutive 
    elements specified by the input iterators.
    </p>
    <p>9. The non-standard member function
    </p>
    <pre>
    std::pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt;    
    write ( iterator  pos , const value_type &  val_new ) ;
</pre>
    <p>has been added to address the problem of the invalidation of data structures and containers 
    of the namespace <code>container_bptree</code>, which can be caused by write operations. 
    The function returns an object of <code>std::pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt;</code> with the 
    following values. If a container was modified, <code>bool</code> component returns 
    <code>true</code> and <code>iterator</code> component  points to the element with the new value, 
    otherwise <code>bool</code> component returns <code>false</code> and <code>iterator</code> 
    component points to an element with a value, which is equivalent to the input value. This function 
    has computational complexity <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case. For more details, 
    see the section <a href="write.html">Restrictions on write operations</a>.     
    </p>
    <p>10. In the classes of associative containers <code>set</code>, <code>mulitset</code>, <code>map</code> 
    and <code>multimap</code> each member function
    </p>
    <pre>
    iterator  erase ( iterator  pos   ) ;
    iterator  erase ( iterator  pos_a ,
                      iterator  pos_b ) ;
</pre>
    <p>returns a valid iterator that points to the element, which is next to the last erased element 
    (<code>++pos</code> or <code>pos_b</code>) and takes the position of the first erased element 
    (<code>pos</code> or <code>pos_a</code>), or <code>container.end()</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>This signature of interface functions better suits containers with random access iterators, 
    since it improves the safety and efficiency of user algorithms. It makes interfaces of associative 
    containers more consistent with STL sequences (<code>vector</code> or <code>list</code>) and provides 
    the advantage of developing generic algorithms. This signature also makes the interfaces of containers 
    more symmetric, since many STL containers have the matching member function
    </p>
    <pre>
    iterator  insert ( iterator pos, const value_type & val_x ) ;    
</pre>
    <p>which returns an iterator.
    </p>
